    Method overriding is an object-oriented programming feature that allows a 

    subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already 

    defined by its superclass or by one of its superclasses. The implementation 

    in the subclass overrides the implementation of the superclass by providing 

    a method with the same name, same parameters or signature, and same 

    return type as the method of the parent class.

# Overloading is the ability to define the same method,

# of parameters or the types of the parameters.     



#     to overload in python we use the last parameter equal none and check it with the if statement
